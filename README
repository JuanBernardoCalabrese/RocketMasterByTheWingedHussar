Rocket Master is a 3D game with a 2D game perspective. It consists if two levels. One is Earth with a gravity of 9.82 m/s and the other is Mars with a gravity of 5.5 m/s (I know it is not the real gravity acceleration).

It is a very simple design, the main focus is on the controls and gameplay. The controls are very predictibles and consistent across the game. You can play it at this link: https://sharemygame.com/@TheWingedHussar/rocketmaster
